# Java-Web-Crawler
Basic gui based java program to rip data of static webpages

idea:
  Is that you can get what you want without the waste so no need to open browser or waste time looking through any website. If there are changes youll know from the result and can persue futher otherwise can disregard with out wasting time.
  
  eg: Fashion site

you can find items you want to mointor
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lightning101/Java-Web-Scaper/master/screenshots/s2.png" />

then enter in web scrapper

if there are changes you can take futher action if not disregard effecitly good for deal sites where same query is run to see if changes.
